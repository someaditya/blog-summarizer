"," Locals has it that there is an evil spirit of a Tantrik (a person who practice black magic) who haunts the place and kill whoever tries to trespass during late night hours.A great spot for experiencing tranquility and a preferred route for several biker groups in India, Ladakh is a high altitude area in the Indian administered part of Jammu and Kashmir state.The Magnetic Hill is a wide open stretch, surrounded by tall and rocky mountains all over, when traveling from the city of Leh to the district town of Kargil.The villagers has it that the reason for these deaths was a heavy hail storm with hailstones as big as 23 centimeters falling on these people and eventually killing them (researchers found cracks on the skulls indicating that the impact was made by something spherical).While, of course, the world knows India as a colorful amalgamation of age old traditions and culture, there are several interesting mystiques that has put researchers and the entire concept of science under scrutiny."

"," To be honest, Foster’s only manages to get into this list because it comes cheap and can be had almost throughout the night without caring about the hole it’s going to burn in the pocket.Good colour, average price, but one will find it difficult to keep drinking this beer throughout the night by the campfire without having the temptation of switching to a different one if available.Maybe because it’s a strong brew and one bottle is enough for its target group of bus/truck drivers to keep awake through the night driving in the hills?Fine taste, good price and great distribution is what makes KF the most widely consumed beer in India.Definitely the tastiest beer blend to have ever come out of our country, Bira has toppled records like balling pins within its short span of existence."

"," In the beginning of the early 1700s, a German Lutheran missionary, Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg set up a printing press in the village and translated the Bible after mastering Tamil.The predominant families of the fishermen, presently occupy mass government housing on the outskirts of the village and the battered European and Indian architecture is being restored by a few private organisations such as the Danish Bestseller Foundation.The New Jerusalem Church , home to Bartholomäus Ziegenbalgis mausoleum, is situated right opposite to Zion, built when German missionaries arrived in 1718.Tranquebar is also a haven for leisure seeking crowds who come to the historical oddity to embed into memory the cries of the sea gulls, the wind-songs of the swaying palms and take spontaneous strolls through the thatched cottages.If all the above still doesn't whet your appetite, you can also hop aboard a boat to Uppanar River, a short ride away from the Fort Beach for a quiet picnic on an isolated island."

"," After a couple of minutes of arguing, we agreed upon a compromise where we would at least eat at Jimmy’s Italian before heading to Shiva’s adobe.The hippie culture of the small hamlet called Mcleodganj has made Shiva Café synonymous to the place.So, I would actually refrain from describing the obvious things about Shiva Café (because I presume Tripoto’s audience is sufficiently traveled to not know about the place) and come straight to why the night that followed was massively interesting.He took a while to decrypt my dream but he inferred that I had had some sort of a revelation in my dream.” “Why would he feel so?” “He said I had a blue tinge on my forehead that morning, and trust me it stayed for over a year.” “And why is it not there anymore?” “I have no clue, dude, it just left my skin as soon as I opened up this café.”After a half an hour more of Monk and drags, we were too dead to even think let alone speak, and so we passed out there itself on the elevated rocky platform outside the main café with blankets on."

"," Goa in India is synonymous with holidays, fun, beaches, gorgeous girls, cheap booze and rejuvenation.Transport : The cheapest way to travel and explore Goa is to rent bikes – taxis are exorbitantly priced (Rs 25/km) and bus network is almost non-existent.You see, beaches tend to be similar in many respects – there’s sun, sand, waves, sunsets, shacks, scantily clad women, adventure sports (not everywhere).It is a single stretch containing 4 kick-ass beaches, 2 forts and tons of great places to wine (or beer, vodka, tequila, whisky) and dine.So take out time to relax on a beach, gazing into the horizon lit by the orange sunset while gorgeous ladies soothe your eyes, cold beer drenches your soul and the cool winds make you feel it’s all a dream"
